This python script defines the Binet formula (explicit formula for the nth fibonacci number) as finction
and passes 1000 x values from (o to 6) from the xlist array and stores the output in the ylist array.

Then the Real and imaginary parts of the outputs stored in the ylist are seperately exported into excel to plot the graph

Note: This is not a x-y graph. The graph assumes the (Imaginary part of the outputs as y-axis) and (Real part of the outputs as x-axis).

python version: 3.10.0
